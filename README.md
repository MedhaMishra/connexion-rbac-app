Additional Considerations
Given more time, the following improvements can be made:

Enhanced UI/UX:

Use Angular Material or Bootstrap for a more polished look.
Add modals for CRUD operations.
Include form validations and error handling.
Advanced State Management:

Implement NgRx or a similar state management library for more complex state management needs.
Unit Tests:

Write comprehensive unit tests for services, components, and state management logic.
Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:

Optimize performance by implementing lazy loading for routes.
Role-based Middleware:

Implement route guards to manage access control more effectively.
